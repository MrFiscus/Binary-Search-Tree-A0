4. Finds the height of a given node
5. Detection when the BST has reached a worst case configuration.

The code also fullfills the following requirements:-
1. Uses header files to organize the code
2. Uses the provided exception handling to manage exceptions and edge cases
3. Uses make files to automate compiling and running of the program
